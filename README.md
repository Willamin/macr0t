# macr0t

## Usage

Generates a project name in the form <PREFIX><NUMBER><LETTER>. Probably the same terrible method neo4j used to determine their name. 

```
$ bin/macr0t [COUNT]
```

COUNT is how many to generate. It defaults to 1 when no argument is provided and when `ARGV[0]` is not an integer.

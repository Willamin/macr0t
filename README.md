# macr0t

## Usage

Generates a project name in the form `<PREFIX><NUMBER><LETTER>`. Probably the same terrible method neo4j used to determine their name. 

```
  $ bin/macr0t [OPTION | COUNT]

    OPTION:
    -h, --help        show this help
    -c, --continuous  continuously run until ^C

    COUNT             how many names to generate
                      (defaults to 1)
```
